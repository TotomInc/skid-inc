# [Skid-Inc](https://totominc.github.io/skid-inc/ "Skid-Inc")

Skid-Inc is an incremental-game with a hacking theme. Actually in early alpha, but playable.

### Want to help?

You don't need to program if you want to help us, you can create issues for any bugs you encounter or give ideas.

Otherwise if you want to code (and help us a lot!):

0. Install NodeJS if not done.
1. Clone the repo.
2. Install all dev dependencies with `npm i`. We recommend you to test your changes on a local server, using `http-server .`.
If you have problems with `http-server .` command, we suggest you to install `http-server` module globally: `npm install http-server -g`. Port by default is `:8080`.
3. Run `grunt` when you finished your code changes. Please, take your time to test the new changes you have done, otherwise we will NOT accept the pull request.
4. Create a new branch and make your changes on it.
5. Create a pull request.

### Team on the project:

- TotomInc: project manager, coding.
- MrPinkCat: coding.
- Tim: art assets.
- Emiel: ideas.

### Workflow:

For any pull request, create your own branch.

Otherwise, all new features currently working on are on a secondary branch.

Once we reach a milestone on this secondary branch (like a new version), we can merge it to the `stable` branch.

The live website branch is `gh-pages`.
