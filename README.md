### Want to help?

You don't need to program if you want to help up, you can create issues for any bugs you encounter or give ideas.

Otherwise if you want to code:

1. Clone the repo.
2. Install all dev dependencies (`npm i`). We recommend you to test your changes on a local server, using `http-server`.
3. Run `grunt` when you finished your code changes. Otherwise, the pull request will not be merged.
4. Create a new branch and make your changes on it.
5. Create a pull request.
